**Relational Database**

**Project by: Roberto Bonilla and Pablo Rodríguez**

# Introduction

Nowadays databases are very important on the Internet. Most companies use Relational Databases. We are developing on LISP/SCHEME
a simple relational database. As part of this project we are going to learn how to program in a functional language interacting with their syntax and environment.

# User Guide

This project is developed in Dr. Racket, you need to download the interpreter and ide in order to run the program. You only have to load the file
 and click on run . After that the prompt will be displayed on the screen and you have to choose a command from the following list:
 
 * addtable / addt
 * insert / ins
 * addReference / addr
 * removeReference / remr
 * update / ud
 * remover / rr
 * deltable / delt
 * query
 * cproc
 * eval
